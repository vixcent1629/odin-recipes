        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This best pumpkin pie recipe came about after many years of 
            experimentation. I've finally perfected what I think is the ideal 
            formula for a rich pumpkin pie that's much less likely to crack on 
            top. Serve garnished with whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 9-inch unbaked pie crust</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Whisk together pumpkin, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl 
                    until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, 
                    salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until 
                    thoroughly combined.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust; crimp edges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Pour filling into crust; 
                lightly tap on the counter to release air bubbles.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until 
                    just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife 
                    inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the edge, should come 
                    out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
